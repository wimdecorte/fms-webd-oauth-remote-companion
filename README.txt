These are the parts that run under FileMaker Server's web server. The remote web site will hand off certain requests to the code here.

Put the files and folders here:

    Windows: 
		
	<FileMaker Server Installation>\HTTPServer\conf\

    macOS:

        HTTPS (port 443): <FileMaker Server Installation>/HTTPServer/htdocs/httpsRoot/

        HTTP (port 80): <FileMaker Server Installation>/HTTPServer/htdocs/

    Ubuntu:

	When using Apache
        HTTPS (port 443): <FileMaker Server Installation>/HTTPServer/htdocs/httpsRoot/

        HTTP (port 80): <FileMaker Server Installation>/HTTPServer/htdocs/

	When using Nginx
	HTTPS (port 443): <FileMaker Server Installation>/NginxServer/htdocs/httpsRoot
		
	HTTPS (port 80): <FileMaker Server Installation>/NginxServer/htdocs/

A simple (gradient-heavy) single pager that revisits a style I messed with on two
previous designs (Tessellate and Telephasic). Fully responsive, built on Sass,
and, as usual, loaded with an assortment of pre-styled elements. Have fun! :)
